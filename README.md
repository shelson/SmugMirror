SmugMirror
==========

Python script to mirror a Smugmug library back to local storage.

This uses smugpy as an API library - created by Chris Hoffman
https://github.com/chrishoffman/smugpy

Requests is used for the actual download actions.

This is currently really dumb - simply run it and put in your
credentials and it'll go off and mirror your entire library.

The mirror destination is currently hardcoded in the script.
